# CNN model for pneumonia detection
This project aims to develop a neural network model able to detect pneumonia disease from a set of X-Ray chest images. To that end, convolutional and pooling layers are used for feature extraction. An evaluation of the model's ability to properly identify pneumonia cases is also included. 

Check out my project in this [python jupiter notebook](https://github.com/noursan/pneumonia_detection/blob/main/pneumonia_detection.ipynb).

The train and test data can be found [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2).
